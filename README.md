# Runtime-Learning-Machine

---

This repository contains the experiments of the **Runtime Learning Machine**, where the framework is validated upon
three different
physical systems in different environments. Respectively, they're:

* [Cart-Pole](./cartpole/README.md) in Openai Gym
* [Quadruped-A1](./quadruped-a1/README.md) in Real-world environment
* [Quadruped-Go2](./quadruped-go2/) in Nvidia IsaacGym
